         No one gonna judge you what you do,
          but <span class="highlight">in China then neighborhood or your friends or your
           families they always judge you what you do and they
            always told you what you should do at a different age.</span>

        <span class="yellowed">Chen</span>: Is it is a really good question.
        <br/>
         <span class="highlight">I don't think American or Canadian is more</span>,
          they kind of have more freedom than Chinese, because
           there are so many people in China, you have limited resources, 
           right? So you have to compete with other guys, right? 
          <br/> Here in Canada, you have tons of resource, tons of land.
            So you don't have to, you don't need to compete with other guys.
             If you put all the Canadians or Americans back to China, 
             they have to, 
        they will become to competitive compete with each other as well.
